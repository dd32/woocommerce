# Manage your Woo Marketplace partner account

Partners selling on the Woo Marketplace can edit their store profile and update their support email from the Partner dashboard. For some changes, we ask that you contact the Marketplace team for help.

To access store settings, click the **Store** menu under **_Settings_** in your [partner dashboard](https://woocommerce.com/wp-admin/).

## Business legal name and contact address

When you first join the WooCommerce Marketplace, we'll ask you to complete the **_Business Legal Name_** and **_Business Contact Address_** fields. These allow us to set up an account for you on our accounting platform so you can get paid for your extension sales.

If you make changes to the business name, you'll see a prompt to resign the **Partner Agreement**. Please click on **Partner Agreement** in the left menu, scroll down and tick the box to agree, then save. If the business name changes to a new entity after you have started selling, we will reach out about setting up a new accounting profile.

To change your vendor name, [please contact us](https://woocommerce.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wcpv-vendor-support).

## Vendor logo and profile

Your vendor logo and profile are a great way to tell more about yourself and your company to prospective customers! This will appear at the public profile for your brand along with your extensions.
