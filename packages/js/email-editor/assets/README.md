# WooCommerce Email Editor Assets

We have deprecated the use of the rich-text files (They are not supported in WordPress 7.0).

Please DO NOT USE. Instead, use the version available in WordPress core.

We are keeping these files here for now to prevent fatal errors for websites with aggressive caching.

These files will be deleted after 2026-08-24.

See <https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/pull/63289> for more info.
